/*
 Class Name: Bridge
 Description: Creates the bridge as Semaphore, which famers are trying to cross.
 Precondition: main class is defined where instance of farmer class is created.
 Postcondition: Calls instances of bridge class and farmer class, runs the farmer thread as specified in the assignment Q1
